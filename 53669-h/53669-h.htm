for elementary practice firing. Ignition cylinders are * * * piece,
and lubricated (<a href="#PARA_49">Par. 49</a>). <b>Use of water, however, should always be
supplemented by firing ignited fuel because water does not give a

<p><em>a.</em> <b>First</b>, remove and discard the ignition cylinder, <b>as
the ignition cylinder should never be present when blowing out fuel
or after blowing out fuel except when preparing for a new mission. To

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3f" id="Page_3f">3</a></span></p>

<p><em>c.</em> <b>If no additional shots are to be fired before refilling
and recharging, open pressure-tank valve by turning handle
counterclockwise.</b> Point the gun away from personnel and blow out
the remaining fuel <b>and pressure</b>, if any, from the fuel tanks by
squeezing the valve lever and grip safety until there is no further
discharge. The trigger should not be used during this operation.
<b>Then close the pressure-tank valve to prevent entrance of foreign
matter into the pressure system.</b></p>

<p><em>d.</em> (Superseded). Carefully remove tank group from the back. This may
be done most easily by sitting or squatting with back to a tree stump,
flat rock, packing box, or other object. Release the body and shoulder
straps and ease tank group off the back. Avoid dropping equipment on
the ground as this may damage it.</p>

in flame thrower pressure tanks, outlets of air compressor, connections,
hose, or cylinders containing compressed air.</p>

<p><em>n.</em> (Added). Hands and tools must be free of oil or grease when
charging or servicing flame thrower pressure systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4f" id="Page_4f">4</a></span></p>

<p><em>o.</em> (Added). Discharge any remaining compressed air in flame
thrower pressure tanks before recharging.</p>

<p><em>p.</em> (Added). If compressed air is to be used, and if any grease,
oil, or flame thrower fuel is detected by sense of smell or sight
within pressure tank and valve assemblies or cylinders, return tanks
or cylinders for cleaning to the appropriate third-echelon maintenance
agency of Chemical Warfare Service.</p>

<p class="noindent padt1"><b>35.1 PEPTIZED FUELS (Added).</b></p>

<p><em>a. Characteristics.</em></p>

<p>(1) Pour more readily than usual thickened
fuels.</p>

<p>(2) Give a larger diameter flame than thickened fuels.</p>

<p>(3) Give longer effective ranges than liquid fuels.</p>

<p>(4) Prepared more quickly in cool temperatures than thickened
fuels.</p>

<p><em>b. Preparation.</em></p>

<p>(1) Open 5-1/4-pound can or cans of thickener.</p>

<p>(2) Add 2 mess kit spoonfuls of water to each can of thickener. Stir
until the water disappears in the thickener. It is not necessary to mix
the water uniformly with all of the thickener.</p>

<p>(3) Proceed at once as directed in paragraph 35. Avoid accidental
addition of any water to the thickener or fuel other than that stated
in (2) above.</p>

<p>(4) Peptized fuels set a little more quickly than the usual thickened
fuels, but their general appearance after setting is the same. After
standing, however, peptized fuels spontaneously become thinner and
may be poured without use of pressure. The time it takes for thinning
to occur depends on the temperature of the fuel. At 75° Fahrenheit or
higher, thinning occurs in approximately 1 to 2 hours. At temperatures
below 60° Fahrenheit, thinning occurs several days after preparation of
the peptized fuel.</p>

<p>(5) If water has accidentally gotten into fuel before addition of
the thickener, peptizing action takes place, but the results are
unpredictable because the quantity of water added is not controlled.</p>

<p class="noindent padt1"><b>36. PREPARATION OF LIQUID FUELS.</b></p>

<p><em>a. Choice of ingredients.</em> Thin fuels are * * * reaching the target.
For this reason, liquid fuels should contain the lowest proportion of
gasoline and the highest proportion of heavier fuels that permit easy
ignition. In hot climates, * * * of great importance. <b>The gasoline
used can be any U. S. grade of motor fuel or aviation gasoline.</b>
Suitable blends are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5f" id="Page_5f">5</a></span></p>

<p class="center">*<span class="add4em">*</span><span class="add4em">
*</span><span class="add4em">*</span><span class="add4em">*</span></p>

<p>(3) (Added). By volume, 20 to 25 percent gasoline and 75 to 80
percent light fuel oil.</p>

<p class="center">*<span class="add4em">*</span><span class="add4em">
*</span><span class="add4em">*</span><span class="add4em">*</span></p>

<p class="noindent padt1"><b>40.1 USE OF PACKBOARDS</b> (Added).</p>

<p class="noindent">Detachable pressure tank and valve assemblies (<a href="#PARA_66">par. 66.1</a>) make possible
the use of packboards for transporting pressure tanks, 5-gallon
cans of fuel, wrenches, and additional ignition cylinders close to the
front line of combat to troops using flame throwers. As packboards
are not manufactured specifically for servicing flame throwers, standard
quartermaster-issue packboards are used. Packboard transportation
is practicable only with pourable fuel. (Pourable fuels include
some thickened fuels and all liquid fuels.)</p>

<p><em>a.</em> The following is a suggested procedure for packboard transportation:</p>

<p>(1) Lash all necessary filling and charging supplies for one flame
thrower to packboard, using lashing rope and straps.</p>

<p>(2) Tie one pressure tank and valve assembly to top of one flat 5-gallon
fuel can so that flexible shaft and handle hang down parallel to
one side of the fuel can.</p>

<p>(3) Carry wrench with large enough opening to unscrew filling
plugs from tops of fuel tanks and to tighten plugs after filling.</p>

<p>(4) Carry extra ignition cylinders.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Return empty pressure tank and valve assembly along with empty
fuel can and wrench on packboard to flame thrower servicing point.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> If a supply of flame thrower tank groups is available, they may
be preferred to the packboard method of transportation. Tank
groups are easy to carry, and a filled and charged tank group can
replace an emptied one as quickly as packboard method can be used to
service flame thrower.</p>

<p class="noindent padt1"><b>66.1 DETACHABLE PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLIES</b>
(Added).</p>

<p>Newly developed detachable pressure tank and valve assemblies provide
an improved and speedier method of servicing M2-2 portable flame
throwers in forward combat zones.</p>

<p><em>a. Description and functioning.</em></p>

<p>(1) Detachable pressure tank and valve assemblies (figs. <a href="#Fig_35p2">35.2</a> and
<a href="#Fig_35p3">35.3</a>) are used in modified flame throwers. They make it unnecessary to
replace empty complete tank groups with filled and charged complete
tank groups.</p>

<p>(2) Replacement of complete tank group, however, may be preferred when
an extra supply of tank groups is available, or if thickened fuel is
too stringy and viscous to pour.</p>

<p>(3) Detachable pressure tank and valve assemblies can be attached only
to flame throwers which include sockets (figs. <a href="#Fig_35p2">35.2</a> and <a href="#Fig_35p3">35.3</a>) and
shortened regulator tubes. Flame throwers produced recently include
this design modification.</p>

<p>(4) A plug and cap (<a href="#Fig_35p3">fig. 35.3</a>) on detachable pressure tank and valve
assembly replace tube elbow (<a href="#Fig_33">fig. 33</a>) used on nondetachable pressure
tank and valve assembly.</p>

<p><em>b. Removal.</em> Care must be taken to prevent damage to connections
during removal and installation. The procedure for removal of pressure
tank and valve assembly is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Close pressure-tank valve. Press valve lever and safety grip on gun
to release all pressure from fuel system and gun.</p>

<p>(2) Unscrew wing nut from valve flexible shaft. (See <a href="#Fig_35p4">fig. 35.4</a>.) Be
careful not to misplace wing nut.</p>

<p>(3) Pull clamp and shaft from stud which is welded on fuel tank.</p>

<p>(4) With one hand under pressure tank, unclamp but do not fully open
pressure-tank clamp.</p>

<p>(5) Supporting pressure tank valve with top of right hand, push knurled
socket in and away from pressure tank valve. Left hand may be placed
at back of regulator tube so that tube does not bend away from socket.
(See <a href="#Fig_35p5">fig. 35.5</a>.) Pull out pressure tank and valve assembly.</p>

<p>(6) Put cap as far as it will go over opening of the plug. (See <a href="#Fig_35p6">fig.35.6</a>.)
This prevents dust and other foreign matter from entering empty
pressure tank.</p>

<p>(7) Flame thrower is now ready to receive a charged pressure tank and
valve assembly. (See <a href="#Fig_35p7">fig. 35.7</a>.)</p>

<p><em>c. Installation.</em> To install a charged or replacement detachable
pressure tank and valve assembly, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Remove dust cap from plug of charged pressure tank and
valve assembly. (Never open pressure-tank valve with cap on plug.)</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 35.6.</span> (Added.) Pressure tank and valve
assembly with dust cap over plug opening.</p></div>

<p>(2) Support socket and tube with left hand and insert plug in socket
with right hand. If tube is not supported, it is difficult to lock the
plug in the socket and it is possible that tube may become bent. Press
bottom of tank until plug snaps into socket. Test by attempting to pull
tank and plug from socket. Plug must not pull out; if it does, insert
again and press bottom of tank. Grasp knurled collar of socket and test
for end play. If collar slides freely back and forth on socket, the
connection is not tight and plug should be pressed in farther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14f" id="Page_14f">14</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Replace small clamp (valve-stem clamp) over stud projecting from
fuel tank, and screw wing nut on stud to secure valve flexible shaft in
place. Do not use wrench on wing nut.</p>

<p><em>d. Maintenance.</em> Follow maintenance instructions given in paragraph
<a href="#PARA_66">66</a>. In addition, if leaks occur and signs of wear are visible, carry
out the following procedures:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Worn washer.</em> Replace synthetic rubber washer by disassembling
socket (<a href="#Fig_35p8">fig. 35.8</a>), prying out washer, placing new washer in position,
and reassembling socket.</p>

and plug. Disassembly is permitted only as directed in paragraph 66.1.</p></div>

<p>(2) <em>Damaged plug.</em> Repair damaged or nicked end of plug by filing plug
end square and smooth. File off as little as possible. Test for leakage
at socket by installing pressure tank and valve assembly, as in c
above, and then opening pressure-tank valve. If leak persists at joint
between socket and plug, replace plug by unscrewing old plug, screwing
new plug in position, and tightening with wrench. Replace entire plug.
Do not attempt to unscrew the cylindrical portion from the square
portion.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although no standard maintenance forms and records are furnished,
an improvised list should be kept of the number of times each flame
thrower has been fired. The list indicates when it is necessary
to provide the after-six-missions preventive maintenance and
lubrication. It should be tacked or glued to the inside surface
of the packing-chest lid and each flame thrower should always be
returned to its own chest.</p>

<p id="PARA_3g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Eliminate enemy nests</span> in street or jungle fighting.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_4">4. CHARACTERISTICS AND EMPLOYMENT.</h4>

<p id="PARA_4a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Action</span>. Fuel is propelled into the target by a charge of
highly compressed air or nitrogen. As fuel leaves the gun of the
M2-2 portable flame thrower (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig 1</a>), it is ignited by contact with
flame from charges of incendiary mix held in an expendable ignition
cylinder.</p>

<p id="PARA_4b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Bursts</span>. A continuous stream or separate bursts may be
fired for approximately 8 to 9 seconds, not including time between
the bursts. The five incendiary charges in the ignition cylinder
are controlled by the trigger and can ignite several bursts.</p>

<p id="PARA_4c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Range</span>. Portable flame throwers are fired at extremely
close or point-blank range for best results. (<a href="#PARA_22">Par 22</a>) Effective
range for liquid fuels (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig 2</a>) is as far as 20 yards, and for thickened
fuels (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig 3</a>), 40 yards, but underbrush and adverse winds
can reduce the distances.</p>

<p id="PARA_4d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Weight</span>. To keep the weight as light as possible and still
provide strength to withstand very high pressures, most parts
are made of aluminum or sheet steel.</p>

<p id="PARA_4e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Tactics</span>. Two or more flame throwers are generally used
on a mission with other weapons of the assault squad. (See FM
31-50, “Attack on a Fortified Position and Combat in Towns.”)</p>

<p id="PARA_4f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Firers and assistants</span>. One man carries and fires each
flame thrower. Well-armed assistants accompany firers to give
close protection and to serve as emergency replacements.
Whereas the M1A1 portable flame thrower may require the help
of an assistant to open the pressure-tank valve, the M2-2 flame
thrower pressure-tank valve is located within reach of the firer
and is operated by him without assistance. Firers and assistants
should be thoroughly trained in operation of the weapon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_4">
<img src="images/i_p005.jpg" width="396" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig 4. Tank group.</p></div>

<p id="PARA_4g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Charging and filling</span>. In order to replace pressure tanks
(cylinders) of earlier types of flame throwers, it is necessary
to unscrew and screw threaded connections. Experience has
shown that this frequently resulted in damage to threads, leakage,
loss of pressure, and loss of range. It is also necessary to use
tools to replace each pressure tank (cylinder). The design of the
M2-2 flame thrower eliminates these difficulties. The tank group
(<a href="#Fig_4">Fig 4</a>) may be charged and filled as a unit with or without gun
and hose. The quick-connecting tank coupling permits rapid
interchanging of empty and full tank groups by the firers or assistants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
This is done without tools, takes very little time, and
cannot cause leakage, loss of pressure, and loss of range due to
damaged threads.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_5">5. DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The flame thrower consists of two major groups: tank group and
gun group. Detailed descriptions of assemblies and parts are
included in Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_66">66</a> through <a href="#PARA_76">76</a>.</p>

<p id="PARA_5a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Tank group</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>) Carried upon the firer’s back,
the tank group holds fuel and pressure. The tank group may be
identified as tank, fuel, portable flame thrower, M2, assembly
D81-1-482. It consists principally of:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Two fuel tanks</span>, holding a total of 4 gallons of fuel, and
joined by a tank connector to form a single fuel reservoir.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Pressure tank</span>, charged with highly compressed air or
nitrogen used to propel fuel from the fuel tanks through the gun
to the target. The tank is large in capacity to assure ample pressure
and uniformly long range throughout the firing.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Pressure-tank valve</span>, which releases air or nitrogen
through the pressure regulator to the fuel tanks. The valve can
be opened by the firer without the assistance required in the case
of the M1A1 flame thrower.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Pressure regulator</span>, which automatically assures delivery
of air or nitrogen to the fuel tanks at the proper pressure. The
regulator is located in a position where it cannot easily be damaged.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) <span class="u">Carrier</span>, which supports the tank group on the firer’s back
and shoulders and secures it to his body. It includes body and
shoulder straps and quick-releasing fasteners.</p>

<p id="PARA_5b"><span class="u">b. Gun group</span>. (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig 6</a>) Carried, aimed, and operated by the
hands of the firer, the gun group ignites the fuel and directs the
flame into the target. It includes:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Fuel hose</span>, which conveys fuel from the tank group to the
gun. The fuel hose may be requisitioned as hose, fuel, portable
flame thrower, M1, assembly B81-1-498.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Gun</span>, which ignites the fuel and directs it to the target.
The gun may be identified as gun, portable flame thrower,
M2, assembly D81-1-405. It consists of:</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">a</span>) <span class="u">Fuel valve</span>, which discharges fuel through the barrel.
The valve is operated by squeezing the valve lever and the grip
safety, which are on opposite sides of the valve grip. The valve
also includes a barrel from which the fuel is ejected. The ignition
head is supported on the front of the barrel.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) <span class="u">Ignition head</span>, which ignites the fuel as it passes
from the nozzle of the barrel. With each pull of the trigger on the
front grip, one of five charges of incendiary mix in an ignition
cylinder is ignited. This pilot flame ignites the fuel as it is
propelled from the gun.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_6">6. IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The words “Chemical Warfare Service,” model numbers, serial
numbers, lot numbers, weight, cubage, manufacturers’ names,
contract number, and date of packing are indicated on the packing
chest or the equipment. The numbers and letters shown on the
equipment should be referred to when repairs are required. The
tank group and the gun (without the fuel hose) may each be marked
“M2” and the fuel hose may be marked “M1,” although all of
these are components of the M2-2 portable flame thrower.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_7">7. DIFFERENCES IN MODELS.</h4>

<p id="PARA_7a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">M2-2 and E3 portable flame throwers</span>. Portable flame
thrower M2-2 is identical in all important respects with portable
flame thrower E3. (The E3 flame thrower, when standardized
with some modifications, became the M2-2.) Operation and maintenance
of the M2-2 and E3 are in general the same, and the parts
are interchangeable.</p>

<p id="PARA_7b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">M2-2, M1, and M1A1 portable flame throwers</span>. Portable
flame thrower M2-2 has the same fuel capacity but differs in
construction from portable flame throwers M1 and M1A1. Parts
are not interchangeable except as stated in Paragraph 8.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_8">8. INTERCHANGING PARTS WITH M1 OR M1A1 FLAME
THROWER.</h4>

<h4 id="PARA_14">14. CONTROLS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The firer uses the pressure-tank valve handle, the trigger, and
the valve lever and grip safety (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig 12</a>) in succession as follows:</p>

<p id="PARA_14a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Valve handle</span>. The pressure-tank valve is operated by turning
a handle on the valve flexible shaft within reach of the firer.
Counterclockwise operation of handle releases pressure to the
fuel tanks. Clockwise turning closes the valve.</p>

<p id="PARA_14b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Trigger</span>. The trigger is at the front grip of the gun. Pulling
the trigger vigorously ignites an incendiary charge in the ignition
cylinder. This in turn ignites the fuel as it leaves the gun. The
trigger action also causes the ignition cylinder to revolve one-fifth
of a turn, presenting another charge for firing. Each of the
five charges may thus be used in rapid succession, if necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
by pulling the trigger vigorously as many as five times.</p>

<p id="PARA_14c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Valve lever and grip safety</span>. The valve lever and grip safety
are mounted on opposite sides of the valve grip of the gun. When
both controls are compressed, fuel is propelled from the gun. If
either the valve lever or the grip safety is not compressed, the
fuel valve remains closed and the fuel remains in the weapon.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="Section_VII_OPERATION_UNDER">Section VII OPERATION UNDER
USUAL CONDITIONS</h3>

<h4 id="PARA_15">15. TRAINING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Effective use of the M2-2 portable flame thrower can be achieved
only by diligent practice with the weapon. Untrained firers or
assistants should never be sent on a mission.</p>

<p id="PARA_15a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Practice</span>. Firers should practice under varying conditions
of wind, range, elevation, depression, and traverse. The shortness
of the total firing time (approximately 8 to 9 seconds) demands
split-second judgment and coordination.</p>

<p id="PARA_15b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Use of water in training</span>. Water may be used (instead of
fuel) for elementary practice firing. Ignition cylinders are not
used with water. The water under pressure may cause serious
injuries to personnel at 10 yards. After practice with water, the
gun should be disassembled (Pars <a href="#PARA_73">73</a> through <a href="#PARA_76">76</a>), cleaned and
dried piece by piece, and lubricated. (<a href="#PARA_49">Par 49</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_15c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Use of fuel in training</span>. When using fuel in training, select
or prepare a practice field of fire which provides at least 125
yards for range and 30 yards for spread. If the field contains
dry grass, brush, or other flammable material, a fire-fighting
squad should be available with equipment and source of water.
Assistants and observers should stay well behind the firer because
of danger from wind shifts. See Paragraph 40 for additional
precautions.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_16">16. CHARGING, FILLING, AND SERVICING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Before use on missions or for training, flame throwers must be
charged, filled, and serviced. Charging with compressed air or
compressed nitrogen is described in Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_32">32 and 33</a>;
filling with fuel in Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_34">34</a> through <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>; and servicing in
Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_50">50</a> through <a href="#PARA_56">56</a>. Test for pressure. (<a href="#PARA_53d">Par 53 <span class="u">d</span></a>)</p>

<h4 id="PARA_17">17. CONNECTING TANK GROUP AND GUN GROUP.</h4>

<p class="noindent">If a charged and filled tank group has been brought up to replace
an emptied one:</p>

<p id="PARA_17a"><span class="u">a</span>. Place the new tank group on the ground with the tank coupling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
on top. If the filling is thickened fuel, allow the tank group
to rest in this position for from 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

<p id="PARA_17b"><span class="u">b</span>. Remove coupling plug from new tank group and disconnect
gun group from emptied tank group. Place unthreaded end of fuel
hose in tank coupling and lock in place. (<a href="#PARA_70">Par 70</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_17c"><span class="u">c</span>. Lock the coupling plug in the emptied tank group.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_18">18. LOADING WITH IGNITION CYLINDER.</h4>

<p id="PARA_18a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">General</span>. Just before the start of a mission, load an unused
ignition cylinder into the ignition head. (M1 and E1 ignition
cylinders are identical and may be used interchangeably.) Cylinders
are packed two to a can. Do not open cans until ready
to load for a mission. The second cylinder in the can should be
used in another flame thrower on the same mission or as soon
as possible after opening the can. Partly used cylinders may be
employed in training.</p>

<p id="PARA_18b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Precautions</span>. Care must be taken, whenever cylinders are
handled, to avoid any blows or pressure against the metal match
ends. (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig 13</a>) Face, hands, and other parts of the body should
never be exposed to front of cylinder or front of gun.</p>

<p id="PARA_18c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Procedure</span>. Loading procedure is as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Unscrew and remove ignition shield. (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig 14</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Place ignition cylinder on end of barrel (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig 15</a>), being
careful not to grasp cylinder by its ends.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) Raise nozzle end of gun so cylinder slides down against the
spring case of the ignition head. (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig 16</a>) If necessary, rotate
cylinder so it slips down all the way. Do not force cylinder
into place as forcing may prematurely ignite it.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) Rotate spring case and ignition cylinder clockwise as far
as they turn freely.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) Place ignition shield over cylinder. Engage the slot in the
shield on the spring-case pin.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) Turn shield, screwing it onto ignition-head body. Make
sure the threads engage during the first turn of the shield. When
the slot on the shield engages the latch on the ignition head (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig 17</a>),
the gun is loaded.</p>

<p class="p2">(7) If shield cannot be turned by hand tight enough to engage
latch, unscrew shield. Then turn shield backwards until threads
engage and repeat (6) above.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_19">19. CARRYING THE TANK GROUP.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The tanks are supported on the firer’s back and secured to it by two
shoulder straps and two pairs of body straps. (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig 18</a>) The straps may
be adjusted by the buckles to fit the operator. The shoulder straps
pass over the shoulders and under the arm pits; the lower body straps
are clasped tightly in front of the body; and the upper body straps are
clasped across the chest to prevent the shoulder straps from slipping
and the tank group from rolling off the back. Adjustments to the
various straps should be made until the unit is carried with the bottom
of the fuel tanks at the small of the operator’s back. The tank group
should fit snugly so that it does not shift if the operator changes
position quickly.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_20">20. CARRYING THE GUN.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_19">
<img src="images/i_p021.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig 19. Carrying the gun, with hands in position to fire.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The procedure for carrying the gun is as follows:</p>

<p id="PARA_20a"><span class="u">a</span>. Carry the gun with the hose at the right side. (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig 19</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_20b"><span class="u">b</span>. Grasp the valve grip with the right hand and the front grip
with the left hand, being careful not to operate the controls until
ready to fire.</p>

<p id="PARA_20c"><span class="u">c</span>. Keep the gun pointed away from friendly personnel at all
times.</p>

<p id="PARA_20d"><span class="u">d</span>. Do not face the front of the gun at any time. Even when no
fuel is being ejected, the incendiary charges of the ignition cylinder
can cause severe burns.</p>

<p id="PARA_20e"><span class="u">e</span>. Keep the gun dry and clean if possible. Avoid getting dirt
or foreign matter into the weapon.</p>

<p id="PARA_20f"><span class="u">f</span>. Avoid rough handling.</p>

<p id="PARA_20g"><span class="u">g</span>. Wear gloves if available.</p>

<p id="PARA_20h"><span class="u">h</span>. Carry any extra ignition cylinders only in metal containers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PARA_21">21. OPENING PRESSURE-TANK VALVE.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The release of pressure into the fuel tank causes a hissing sound.
Therefore, open the pressure-tank valve while still out of hearing
range of the enemy. Do not, however, open it prematurely because
of the possibility of pressure leaks. To prevent frothing
of the fuel, keep the tank group in as nearly an upright position as
possible when opening pressure-tank valve. Be sure to turn the
valve handle all the way in a counterclockwise direction. Stiffening
of the fuel hose occurs when the pressure-tank valve is opened.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_22">22. RANGES.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Firers and assistants should learn to judge ranges by frequent
practice under varying conditions. The firers should be trained
to approach as close as practicable to the target and to fire if
possible at point-blank range for the greatest results.</p>

<p id="PARA_22a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Point-blank range.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Effects</span>. At very close (point-blank)
range almost all of the burning fuel can be fired at great velocity
directly through ports and openings into the target. Maximum
casualties and damage are caused in the hostile position.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Protection</span>. Common sense precautions are taken to prevent
casualties to friendly personnel from possible ricochet or
rebounding of flame. If the target includes a vertical wall at a
right angle to the firer or other friendly personnel, the weapon
should not be fired at closer than 7 to 10 yards. When the weapon
is fired at small openings in a bunker or pillbox, the firer and
other members of the assault squad should not approach closer
than 7 to 10 yards from the target.</p>

<p id="PARA_22b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Other effective ranges.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Open fields of fire</span>. When
thickened gasoline is used, portable flame throwers may fire
with considerable effect as far as 40 yards under normal conditions,
depending on wind direction and wind speed. Under the
same conditions, liquid fuel maybe effective at 20 yards. Results
and accuracy are not as great as at point-blank range.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Jungle or thick underbrush</span>. If the target is located in
jungle or thick underbrush without cleared fields of fire, the
effective range of the flame thrower is reduced by as much as
one half, depending on the nature and density of the vegetation.</p>

<p id="PARA_22c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Ineffective ranges</span>. Although the flame may reach considerably
farther than the ranges stated in <span class="u">b</span> (1) above it may be
useless because of the steep angle of descent and because much
of the fuel is burned before it reaches the target.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_23">23. WIND DEFLECTION.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Wind is an important factor because of the low velocity of the
flaming fuel. Wind can lengthen, shorten, or deflect the flame.</p>

<p id="PARA_23a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Head winds</span>. Head winds of more than 5 miles per hour tend
to carry heat or even flame back toward the firer. Liquid fuel
should not be fired into a head wind of more than 5 miles per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hour. The range and accuracy of thickened fuels is reduced.</p>

<p id="PARA_23b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Following winds or very light winds</span>. Best results are obtained
under these conditions.</p>

<p id="PARA_23c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Cross winds</span>. When firing at or near maximum range, cross
winds deflect, breakup, and disperse the flame. They also reduce
the range.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_24">24. FIRING POSITIONS.</h4>

<p id="PARA_24a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Ease of aiming</span>. The flame thrower can be fired from any position
that permits sufficient freedom to aim the weapon, subject to the
conditions in <span class="u">b</span>, <span class="u">c</span>, and <span class="u">d</span>, below. This includes standing,
kneeling, and prone. In some instances, flame throwers have been fired
with tank groups resting on the ground or on skids. If used in this
way, the tops of the fuel tanks must be propped up to conform to <span class="u">b</span>,
below.</p>

<p id="PARA_24b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Angles of the tanks</span>. When firing, the bottoms of the fuel
tanks must always be substantially lower than the tops. The tops
of both tanks must also each be the same distance above the horizontal
and neither tank should be tilted to one side. Otherwise,
only a small part of the fuel may be blown from the tanks.</p>

<p id="PARA_24c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Recoil</span>. Stability must be sufficient to withstand the recoil
from the gun. If possible, the firer should hold the gun snugly
against his right side to support it and to absorb its recoil.</p>

<p id="PARA_24d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Protection</span>. Full advantage should be taken of cover and
concealment, such as shell craters and vegetation.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_25">25. AIMING.</h4>

<p id="PARA_25a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Sighting</span>. There are no sights on the gun because of the
short range from which it is fired, the variety of fuels used, and
the marked effects of wind. (<a href="#PARA_23">Par 23</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_25b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Fortifications</span>. When firing at a fortified position, flame
must be directed <span class="u">into openings</span> (gun ports, firing slits, ventilation
screens, doorways). Flame inside gives the desired effects, but
flame on the outside has little effect on personnel within.</p>

<p id="PARA_25c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Thickened fuel</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#Fig_20">20</a>) When firing at or near
maximum range, it may take several seconds for a burst of thickened
fuel to carry through the air to the target area. Short bursts
may result in misses at long range for this reason. Skill in aiming
is particularly important with thickened fuel.</p>

<p id="PARA_25d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Liquid fuel</span>. With liquid fuel, the greatest effect may be obtained
by placing the flame directly on the target. (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig 21</a>)</p>

<h4 id="PARA_26">26. FIRING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">With pressure-tank valve open:</p>

<p id="PARA_26a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Pull trigger</span>. Pull the trigger rapidly and vigorously. A
flash should appear at the front of the gun. This shows that an
incendiary charge of the ignition cylinder has been ignited. Release
the trigger. (If the flash does not appear, pull the trigger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
again, or as often as necessary up to five times, until a flash appears.)</p>

<p id="PARA_26b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Squeeze fuel valve</span>. Immediately after pulling trigger, compress
the valve lever and grip safety vigorously with the right
hand. Burning fuel will be propelled from the gun.</p>

<p id="PARA_26c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Adjust fire</span>. Direct the flaming fuel at the target. Continue
to squeeze the valve lever and grip safety throughout the burst.
When thickened fuel is fired, follow the fuel with eyes to the side
of the stream in order to observe and correct aim. (If eyes are
directly behind the stream, the flame may obscure the target.)</p>

<h4 id="PARA_27">27. CEASING OR INTERRUPTING FIRE.</h4>

<p class="noindent">To cease or interrupt firing, release the controls.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_28">28. ADDITIONAL BURSTS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">To fire additional bursts, repeat procedure followed in Paragraphs
26 and 27, keeping in mind that there are five incendiary charges
in the ignition cylinder and that the total firing time, not including
time between bursts, is approximately 8 to 9 seconds. Each of
the five incendiary charges in the ignition cylinder burns for
from 8 to 12 seconds.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_29">29. SOAKING THE TARGET.</h4>

<p class="noindent">When liquid fuel is used, it may be desirable to soak the target
with fuel first and ignite it afterward. To do this, fire one or two
short bursts without pulling the trigger. Then follow with an ignited
burst, as in Paragraph <a href="#PARA_26">26</a>.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_30">30. AFTER FIRING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">When the firer has returned from his mission, he should:</p>

<p id="PARA_30a"><span class="u">a</span>. Remove and discard the ignition cylinder, as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Point gun at the ground.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Press latch. (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig 14</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(3) Unscrew the ignition shield and allow ignition cylinder to
fall out. (Be careful to keep the hands away from the front of the
cylinder.)</p>

<p class="p2">(4) Save the partly used cylinder for training use or destroy
it by firing from gun after fuel tanks have been emptied. For information
on care, handling, and storage of cylinders, see Paragraph <a href="#PARA_31">31</a>.</p>

<p id="PARA_30b"><span class="u">b</span>. Close the pressure-tank valve by turning valve handle
clockwise (to conserve remaining pressure in pressure tank).</p>

<p id="PARA_30c"><span class="u">c</span>. Point the gun away from personnel and blow out the remaining
fuel, if any, from the fuel tanks by squeezing the valve
lever and grip safety until there is no further discharge. The
trigger should not be used during this operation.</p>

<p id="PARA_30d"><span class="u">d</span>. Take off tank group from the back.</p>

<p id="PARA_30e"><span class="u">e</span>. Inspect, clean, and maintain the flame thrower (Pars <a href="#PARA_55">55</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<a href="#PARA_56">56</a>) or, if experienced maintenance personnel is close at hand, turn
the weapon over to them for servicing.</p>

<p id="PARA_30f"><span class="u">f</span>. After servicing, place the weapon in the packing chest (<a href="#PARA_77">Par 77</a>)
for protected storage, or prepare it for the next mission.

<p id="PARA_31a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Description and functioning</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_13">13</a> and <a href="#Fig_22">22</a>) Either the
M1 or E1 ignition cylinder may be used. It fits over the fore
part of the barrel assembly and is revolved by the spring case.
(<a href="#PARA_76">Par 76</a>) The five incendiary charges in the cylinder are spaced
sufficiently far apart in the plastic body to prevent their igniting
one another. Lead-foil seals, plastic closure plates, and waterproof
cement make the unit comparatively waterproof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_22">
<img src="images/i_p027.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig 22. Cutaway view of ignition cylinder (M1 or E1).</p></div>

<p id="PARA_31b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Action</span>. When the trigger rod is pushed forward, one of five
metal matches tipped with red phosphorus scratches an igniting
mixture. The ignition carries to a starter mix and to a few grains
of black powder on top of the incendiary charge. The black powder
blows the foil seal and closure plate clear of the flame thrower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and the incendiary charge ignites the fuel as it is discharged from
the nozzle. The incendiary charge burns for from 8 to 12 seconds.</p>

<p id="PARA_31c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Packing</span>. Ignition cylinders are packed two per waterproof
can. Three cans are furnished with each flame thrower. Fifty
cans (100 ignition cylinders) are contained in each packing box of
extra cylinders.</p>

<p id="PARA_31d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Care, handling, and storage</span>. Ignition cylinders contain
hazardous incendiary material and must be handled with due care.
The following precautions should be observed.</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Opening cans</span>. Do not open cans containing cylinders until
ready to load for a mission. (<a href="#PARA_18">Par 18</a>) If an extra cylinder remains
in an opened can, use it as soon as possible. Any defective cylinders,
such as those with damaged closure plates, should be
destroyed. (Pars <a href="#PARA_30">30</a> and <a href="#PARA_46">46</a>) Moisture may affect the cylinders
and all possible care should be taken to avoid exposing them to
dampness.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Handling cylinders</span>. Pressure on any of the five metal
matches (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig 13</a>) may ignite an incendiary charge in the cylinder.
Care must be exercised to avoid putting pressure on the projecting
ends of the matches except when firing the weapon. Ignition
cylinders and cylinder containers should be protected against
shock. Boxes and cans containing cylinders must not be thrown
or dropped.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Storing containers</span>. Containers of ignition cylinders are
best stored in a dry, well-ventilated place, out of the direct rays
of the sun, well protected against excessive temperatures. Smoking
is not permitted and matches are not used where ignition cylinders
are stored.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_32">32. CHARGING PRESSURE TANK.</h4>

<p id="PARA_32a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">General</span>. The pressure tank of the flame thrower must be
fully charged with compressed air or compressed nitrogen before
the start of a mission. For the M2-2 flame thrower, a pressure
of at least 1,700 pounds per square inch is required. This may be
provided either by the use of an air compressor capable of producing
a pressure of at least 1,700 pounds per square inch, or
by the use of commercial cylinders. The filling and charging
lines from the service kit are used in conjunction with the cylinders.
Before and after charging, follow the procedures described
in Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_51">51</a> and <a href="#PARA_55">55</a>.</p>

<p id="PARA_32b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Charging from air compressor</span>. Compressor, air, gasoline
engine driven, 7CFM, M1, is a self-contained, skid-mounted
machine designed for use with flame throwers. It is capable of
charging pressure tanks of flame throwers and large 200-&nbsp;or
220-cubic-foot commercial cylinders as well. Instructions for
use of the compressor will be found in the manual accompanying it.</p>

<p id="PARA_32c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Charging from cylinders</span>. If an air compressor is not available,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
it is necessary to use cylinders containing nitrogen or air.</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Volume and pressure</span>. Cylinders come charged with 200
to 220 cubic feet of air or nitrogen. Since cylinders with 220
cubic feet of air or nitrogen have a higher initial pressure,
it is recommended that they be procured, if obtainable. All cylinders
used must have a pressure of at least 600 pounds per
square inch. One or more of the cylinders must have a pressure
of at least 1,800 pounds per square inch. Two or more cylinders,
preferably at least four, should be used, if available.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Charging capacity</span>. Fully charged cylinders, if properly
used in rotation, have capacity for charging pressure tanks
approximately as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Apparatus</span>. The apparatus for charging two pressure tanks
by the use of cylinders consists of a filling line, two charging
lines, and two cylinders. (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig 23</a>) The filling line and charging
lines are obtained from the service kit. (<a href="#PARA_48">Par 48</a>) Plugs are provided
to close off either half of the filling line when only one
flame-thrower tank group is to be charged.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Warning</span>. Oxygen is sometimes shipped in cylinders having
the same threads as nitrogen cylinders. If oxygen not mixed
with nitrogen, as in air, is introduced into the fuel tanks of the
portable flame thrower, a violent explosion may result. Therefore,
the greatest care must be exercised to see that only air or
nitrogen is used. <span class="u">Before a cylinder is connected, it should be
tested to determine that it does not contain straight oxygen or
some combustible gas</span>. This may be done by introducing a burning
splint into a jet of the contents. Oxygen causes the splint
to burn quickly, whereas nitrogen extinguishes the flame. To
make the test:</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">a</span>) Fasten a thin splint of wood to a wire at least a foot long.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) Ignite the splint.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">c</span>) Stand aside and hold it before the cylinder outlet.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">d</span>) Crack the valve slightly to permit a small stream of gas
to emerge.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">e</span>) If the flame flares up, the gas is oxygen and <span class="u">MUST NOT</span>
be used.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">f</span>) If the gas itself catches fire, it may be hydrogen, acetylene,
or some other combustible gas, which also must not be used.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) <span class="u">Attaching lines to cylinders</span>. (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig 23</a>) The procedure for

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) Open cylinder valves.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">c</span>) Determine which cylinder has the lower pressure by the

and fill the pressure tanks until they reach pressures of at least
1,700 pounds per square inch as shown by the gage.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">d</span>) When the pressure tanks have been filled, close the filling-line
valves. Open the bleeders on the charging lines and leave
them open until the pressure in the charging lines is released.

the valve with a wrench.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) When the higher pressure shown on the filling-line gages

<h4 id="PARA_33">33. PRECAUTIONS WHEN PRESSURE-CHARGING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Personnel will familiarize themselves with the following precautions:</p>

<p id="PARA_33a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u"> Handling</span>. Handle all cylinders and flame throwers carefully;
never drop them and never subject them to shocks or blows.
Keep valve-protection caps secured when cylinders are being
handled, except when such handling is incident to the use of the
nitrogen or air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p id="PARA_33b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u"> Storage</span>. Keep all cylinders and charged flame throwers or
tank groups (<a href="#PARA_77">Par 77</a>) in open or closed storage. They must, however,
be protected from dampness and excessive rise in temperature
caused by the direct rays of the sun or other source of heat.
Avoid storing them near highly flammable substances, or in places
where they may be struck by moving objects. Segregate empty
cylinders to avoid confusion.</p>

<p id="PARA_33c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u"> Personnel</span>. Do not attempt to use compressed gases unless
trained in this work. Use gases only for the purposes for which
they are intended.</p>

<p id="PARA_33d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u"> Cylinder valves</span>. Do not tamper with safety devices in cylinder
valves. If available, use the proper replacement parts
for safety devices which are in need of repair. If such parts are
not available, do not attempt to use makeshifts or nonstandard
parts.</p>

<p id="PARA_33e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u"> Opening of valves</span>. Open valves slowly and fully each time
nitrogen or compressed air is transferred from a cylinder. When a
wrench is used, be sure it is one that fits properly, and that it is
kept ready for instant use while the compressed gas is being released.</p>

<p id="PARA_33f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u"> Threads</span>. See that threads match before making connections.
Some valves are provided with special threads which must be
matched by the threads in the equipment being connected.</p>

<p id="PARA_33g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u"> Correct equipment</span>. Use gages, regulators, hose, pipe, and
tubing of the type manufactured or specified for the particular
apparatus or compressed gas.</p>

<p id="PARA_33h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u"> Repair</span>. Never attempt to alter or repair a cylinder.</p>

<p id="PARA_33i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u"> Flames and sparks</span>. Do not permit flames, sparks, or ignition
from the flame thrower or other source to touch hose.</p>

<p id="PARA_33j"><span class="u">j</span>. <span class="u"> Blowing out dust</span>. Immediately before coupling an attachment to the
pressure tank or cylinder valve, open it for an instant to blow out any
dust or dirt. Never stand where gas or dirt may be blown into the eyes
or face. If the valve is difficult to open, apply more force gradually.</p>

<p id="PARA_33k"><span class="u">k</span>. <span class="u"> Special devices</span>. Do not attempt to use any special connections or
equipment without the approval of a qualified expert.</p>

<p id="PARA_33l"><span class="u">l</span>. <span class="u"> Keeping valves closed</span>. Keep the valve of each cylinder closed when
its contents are not actually being released from or admitted to the
cylinder. This applies alike to all cylinders, whether they contain a
compressed gas or are empty.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_34">34. CHARACTERISTICS OF FUELS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Thickened fuels give up to twice the range of liquid fuels. The
stream of thickened fuel is comparatively narrow. Most of the
glue-like fuel clings to and burns in or on the target for as long
as 6 minutes. Liquid fuels, on the other hand, are largely consumed
in flight to the target. If the location of small openings
in the target is known, the stream of thickened fuel can be spotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
by accurate aiming so that most of the fuel enters directly
into the openings. While it does not billow around corners as
does liquid fuel, thickened fuel strikes the target with force enough
to ricochet inside. It clings to skin and clothing while burning.
It also has excellent incendiary effects. The initial flame and
smoke are less from thickened fuel than from liquid fuel, but the
lower visibility, greater range, and much longer burning period
of thickened fuel compensate for its smaller screening effect.
Liquid fuels are easier to pour when filling than are thickened
fuels.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_35">35. PREPARATION OF THICKENED FUELS.</h4>

<p id="PARA_35a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Ingredients</span>. Thickened fuels consist of U.S. Army fuel
thickener mixed with fuel.</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Thickener</span>. U.S. Army thickener is supplied in airtight
cans, each containing 5-1/4 pounds of the material.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Gasoline and fuel oil</span>. Gasoline alone is often used with
thickener, but mixtures of gasoline and light fuel oil may be used
satisfactorily. The light fuel oil can be either No. 1 fuel oil, No.
2 fuel oil, automotive diesel oil, or kerosene. These mixtures
give more heat and do not form crusts. Except in hot climates,
75 percent or more of the mixture by weight or volume should
be gasoline. (If too much light fuel oil is included, the fuel tends
to separate into two layers.) In tropical theaters, a thickened
blend of 50 percent gasoline and 50 percent light fuel oil has been
reported to give favorable results. Storage qualities are not
known, however. Another mixture which has been well recommended
in field reports is 15 gallons of gasoline to 5 gallons of
diesel fuel oil. Issue gasoline may be used, but locally procured
gasolines which contain alcohol are not suitable.</p>

<p id="PARA_35b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Proportion of thickener to fuel</span>. Less thickener is recommended
than formerly. A low ratio of thickener gives a thickened
fuel with many of the characteristics of liquid fuel. One
can of thickener to 20 U.S. gallons of gasoline, or gasoline and
light fuel-oil mixture, gives good results. This is a 4.2 percent
by weight mixture. Except in hot weather, a fuel mixture of less
than 3 percent thickener requires such long stirring that its preparation
is impractical.</p>

<p id="PARA_35c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Equipment</span>. An open-head 55-gallon or 42-gallon drum and
an improvised wooden mixing paddle are used. Five-gallon cans
may be employed to transfer the ingredients. The paddle should
be approximately 5 feet long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.
If a standard 55-gallon, open-head drum with an internal diameter
of 27-7/16 inches is used, the improvised paddle should be marked
to indicate gallons as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="myleft" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="paddle markings">
<tr>
<th class="tdc normal"><span class="u">Gallons</span></th>
<th class="tdr normal"><span class="add2em"><span class="u">Inches</span></span></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">40</td>
<td class="tdr">23-1/2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">20</td>
<td class="tdr">11-3/4</td>
</tr></table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Do not use a metal paddle because of the danger of striking a
spark from the drum. Never use galvanized containers for mixing
and storing thickened fuels. These may cause the fuel to break
down and become excessively thin. An improvised funnel may be
helpful in filling drums with prepared fuel for aging or transporting.</p>

<p id="PARA_35d"><span class="u">d. Temperatures.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Below 50 degrees</span>. If the temperature is
below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, it is helpful to prepare thickened
fuel indoors, in a heated room. All precautions should be particularly
observed. (<a href="#PARA_40">Par 40</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Above 90 degrees</span>. When the fuel is hotter than 90 degrees
Fahrenheit, the thickener reacts very rapidly. In this case, it is
easier to prepare batches of 20 gallons each, but any number of
batches may be prepared in succession.</p>

<p id="PARA_35e"><span class="u">e. Moisture.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Effect of moisture</span>. Water in thickened fuel
breaks down or reduces the viscosity of the gel and thereby reduces
the range of the flame thrower. This effect may not be
noticeable at once, but the stability of the fuel is affected.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Dryness of thickener</span>. Dry thickener is extremely hygroscopic,
that is, it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere very
rapidly. For this reason, thickener is shipped in hermetically
sealed tin cans containing the exact quantity of powder required
for mixing with 20 gallons of fuel to prepare a 4.2 percent mixture.
It is important that the gasoline or fuel oil and gasoline
be measured out before the thickener container is opened. The
powder then should be poured immediately into the liquid.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Dryness of containers</span>. It is important that all containers
used in mixing and handling the fuel be dry.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Keeping water out of gasoline</span>. Gasoline, especially when
it has been stored in vented containers, frequently includes free
water. Therefore, when using gasoline from a bulk-storage tank
or an open drum, first place it in a clean, dry drum; allow it to
stand quietly for at least an hour; then carefully pour off the
gasoline from the top and discard the last gallon or two.</p>

<p id="PARA_35f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Pouring and stirring</span>. (<a href="#Fig_25">Fig 25</a>) The liquid fuel is poured
into the open drum; a pail or a paddle (<a href="#PARA_35c">Par 35 <span class="u">c</span></a>) is used for measuring.
One man then stirs the fuel vigorously. Another takes a
can of thickener, splits it with a machete, bayonet, or ax, and
pours it immediately into the fuel. Any large lumps of powder
are broken by hand before the powder is added to the fuel. When
mixing 40 gallons at a time, the two cans of thickener should be
opened and added to the fuel in rapid succession. If the contents
of the first can are permitted to gel before adding the second can,
it will be difficult to obtain a uniform mix. Continue to stir.</p>

<p id="PARA_35g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Examining fuel</span>. Lift the paddle quickly. If the mixture
drops or runs from the paddle, additional stirring is necessary.
When the paddle comes out clean, except for an adhering film,
stirring should be stopped, provided there is no further visible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
settling of particles of thickener.</p>

<p id="PARA_35h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u">Loading shipping drums</span>. When stirring is completed, the
mix is immediately bucketed (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig 26</a>) through a funnel into the
shipping drum. The second bung hole should be open, if possible,
to provide a vent to aid in pouring. Two men do the bucketing,
each handling one pail so that the funnel may be kept loaded with
mix and the shipping drum filled as rapidly as possible. Finally,
the open-end drum should be picked up and its contents poured
into the funnel. Not more than 50 gallons of thickened fuel should
be loaded into a 55-gallon drum. The funnel should then be removed
and replaced by a plug. The vent opening of the drum should
also be closed. (See Paragraph 39 for pressure method of filling
storage drums.)</p>

<p id="PARA_35i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u">Unused thickener</span>. Any thickener remaining in opened cans
should be discarded. Since moisture in the air can quickly ruin
its properties, no attempt should be made to save it.</p>

<p id="PARA_35j"><span class="u">j</span>. <span class="u">Aging and storing</span>. Newly mixed fuel has the appearance of
tapioca pudding. (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig 27</a>) It should preferably be stored overnight
before use. It may, however, be fired within 1 hour after mixing.
To keep fuel in good condition, drums for shipping and storing
must be clean, moistureproof, dry, strong, and unrusted, but not
galvanized. They must be kept tightly closed and should be laid
on their sides so that rain water will not collect around the bungs.</p>

<p id="PARA_35k"><span class="u">k</span>. <span class="u">Testing fuel</span>. Before use on missions, all fuels should be
tested by being fired from a flame thrower. This is advisable
because the characteristics of the fuel ingredients often vary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PARA_36">36. PREPARATION OF LIQUID FUELS.</h4>

<p id="PARA_36a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Choice of ingredients</span>. Thin fuels are easy to ignite, but
they lack range and are largely burned in flight before reaching
the target. For this reason, liquid fuels should contain the lowest
proportion of gasoline and the highest proportion of heavier oils
that permits easy ignition. In hot climates, less gasoline is
needed than in cold climates. Exactness of proportion, however,
is not of great importance. Suitable blends are as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Equal parts by weight or by volume of gasoline, light fuel
oil, and heavy (bunker) fuel oil. The light fuel oil can be either
No. 1 fuel oil, No. 2 fuel oil, automotive diesel oil, or kerosene.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) One part gasoline to four parts of cleaned crankcase drainings.
(<a href="#PARA_36e">Par 36<span class="u">e</span></a>) Unused motor lubricating oil can be employed in
place of crankcase drainings, but usually it will be unavailable
for flame-thrower use.</p>

<p id="PARA_36b"><span class="u">b. Preparation of ingredients</span>. Before mixing blends, the following
steps should be taken:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Gasoline, diesel oils, and fuel oils</span>. These fuel materials
should be allowed to stand quietly for at least 30 minutes to permit
any small quantity of water present to settle to the bottom.
When transferring the fuel to another container, remove the fuel
carefully so that no water is remixed with it.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Crankcase drainings</span>. If possible, crankcase drainings
should be allowed to stand quietly in a container for at least 1 day.
When pouring, take care to prevent the transfer of any of the
sludge which may have settled in the bottom of the container.</p>

<p id="PARA_36c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Equipment</span>. An open-head 55-gallon or 42-gallon drum and
an improvised wooden mixing paddle are used. The paddle should
be approximately 5 feet long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. A
metal paddle should not be provided because of the danger of striking
a spark from the drum. Five-gallon cans may also be furnished
for measuring and transferring ingredients. Clean, unrusted,
steel storage drums should be at hand. They should be at
least 16-gage to have sufficient strength to withstand the internal
vapor pressure of the fuel.</p>

<p id="PARA_36d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Stirring</span>. All the ingredients should be stirred in the drum
with the paddle until they appear to form a uniform mixture.
This should require approximately 2 minutes.</p>

<p id="PARA_36e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Crankcase-draining blends</span>. If crankcase drainings are
used as an ingredient (<a href="#PARA_36b">Par 36<span class="u">b</span></a>), it is preferable to allow the prepared
mixture to settle for 24 hours after stirring, because the
gasoline in the mixture may cause additional sludge to be deposited.
Even after this settling period, it is recommended that the
mixture be poured through cheesecloth or some similar fabric
before the flame thrower is filled. Crankcase-draining blends
should be allowed to stay in the flame thrower only long enough
for completion of a mission, because additional sludge which may
form from standing will clog the weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p id="PARA_36f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Transferring</span>. The mixture should be transferred either
directly into the flame-thrower fuel tanks (Pars <a href="#PARA_37">37</a> through <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>)
or into storage drums. (<a href="#PARA_35h">Par 35<span class="u">h</span></a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_36g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Emergency mixing in fuel tanks</span>. In an emergency, mixing
can be done in the flame-thrower fuel tanks by adding the ingredients
in correct proportions and then shaking or stirring.</p>

<p id="PARA_36h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u">Testing fuel</span>. Before fuel is used on a mission, it should
be tested, if possible, by being fired from a flame thrower.</p>

<p id="PARA_36i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u">Storage</span>. Fuels may be used immediately after preparation.
If the blend contains crankcase oils, the fuel should be fired as
soon as practicable after filling. Other liquid blends may be
stored indefinitely until required for use. For storage precautions
see Paragraph <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>. The storage drums also should be kept
tightly closed to prevent loss of gasoline through evaporation and
to prevent moisture from entering the fuel. If stored in the open,
the drums should be laid on their sides so that rain water will not
collect adjacent to the bungs. An unrusted and undamaged 16-gage
or 18-gage drum has sufficient strength to withstand the
internal vapor pressure of the fuel.</p>

<p class="noindent">(<a href="#Fig_28">Fig 28</a>) This method is the simplest and quickest for liquid fuel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
but it may be too slow for some thickened fuels. The procedure is as
follows:</p>

<p id="PARA_37a"><span class="u">a</span>. Stand the tank group on the ground or a platform. If the tank
group is not connected to the gun group, lock coupling plug in tank
coupling. (<a href="#PARA_70">Par 70</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_37b"><span class="u">b</span>. Using a 1-3/4-inch wrench, unscrew the filling plug and the
safety-head plug.</p>

<p id="PARA_37c"><span class="u">c</span>. Inspect interior of tanks to see if clean and free from foreign
matter. If not clean, flush with gasoline.</p>

<p id="PARA_37d"><span class="u">d</span>. Using an improvised funnel, fill to within 2 inches of the top of
both plug openings. This allows sufficient void. The tanks will then
contain approximately 4 gallons of fuel.</p>

<p id="PARA_37e"><span class="u">e</span>. Wipe the fuel-tank plug seats and the plug threads with a clean,
dry cloth. (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig 29</a>) If plug has a tendency to freeze to seat, lubricate
(<a href="#PARA_49b">Par 49 <span class="u">b</span></a>) before screwing in the filling and safety-head plug
assemblies. Tighten with wrench.</p>

<p id="PARA_37f"><span class="u">f</span>. Wipe any spilled fuel from weapon.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_38">38. FILLING BY FORCE PUMP.</h4>

<p class="noindent">A force pump, if available, may be installed with a short length of
pipe in the top opening of a drum of fuel for filling flame-thrower
fuel tanks. Keep working parts of pump clean.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_39">39. FILLING BY BLOWING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Thickened fuel may be readily forced into the fuel tanks of flame
throwers by the use of extremely low pressures of compressed
air or nitrogen. Flame thrower fuel filling kit E6 or equivalent
may be used. When equipment is available, filling by blowing is
more efficient for filling large numbers of flame throwers with
thickened fuel. Pouring or pumping are more time-consuming,
depending on the consistency of the gel. The consistency may vary
among batches even when the same proportion of thickener is
used. The amount of moisture in the fuel seems to cause this
variation. The precautions listed in Paragraph <a href="#PARA_40">40</a> should be
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_30">
<img src="images/i_p041.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig 30. Blowing thickened fuel into fuel tanks by use of
cylinders of compressed air or nitrogen.</p></div>

<p id="PARA_39a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Source of pressure</span>. When the pressure in cylinders of compressed
air or nitrogen has fallen too low to be of further use in filling
pressure tanks of flame throwers, the remaining pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> may be used
to blow fuel into fuel tanks if the regulator valve can reduce pressure
down to 20 pounds per square inch. For precautions, see Paragraph <a href="#PARA_33">33</a>.
An air compressor or a hand air pump (tire pump) may be used in place
of a cylinder if the latter is not available. Pressure of <span class="u">no more than
15 to 20 pounds</span> per square inch should be used on the fuel drums. Only
a diaphragm-type regulator valve can be used safely. This valve must be
capable of regulating any pressure that may be applied to it.</p>

<p id="PARA_39b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Drums</span>. Clean, noncorroded, steel, 55-gallon drums should be used.
Drums of United States manufacture which meet requirements will be
stamped ICC-5 or ICC-5A, followed by three numbers in sequence, for
example, “14-55-44.” The number “14” indicates the gage of the metal;
“55” indicates the capacity in gallons; and “44” indicates the year
of manufacture. A steel drum of 14 gage, or heavier, is preferable,
but lighter drums (of 16 or 18 gage) may be used. Drums made of gages
lighter than 18 gage (20-or 22-gage) must not be used. Drums should
never be moved while under pressure.</p>

<p id="PARA_39c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Connections</span>. The source of pressure (see <a href="#PARA_39a"><span class="u">a</span></a> above), the drum
of fuel, the fuel-filling line, the air hose, and other parts, are
connected as shown in <a href="#Fig_30">Figure 30</a>. Threaded adapters are used, as
necessary, to fit lines to the drum. All threaded connections should
be made tight by the use of wrenches on the joints. The drum and the
pressure cylinder (if the latter is used) should be laid on their sides
on the ground or a platform. The opening of the drum connected to the
fuel-filling hose should be close to the ground or platform. If tank
group is filled without gun group, lock coupling plug (<a href="#PARA_70">Par 70</a>) in tank
coupling.</p>

<p id="PARA_39d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Procedure</span>. To fill fuel tanks:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Remove both the filling and safety-head plugs.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Inspect interior of tanks to see if clean and free from foreign
matter. If not clean, flush with gasoline.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) Place end of fuel-filling hose in either one of the two fuel-tank
plug holes, using a nipple as a spout.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) Start air compressor or pump, or open the valve on the cylinder of
compressed air or nitrogen. Open regulator valve on filling line by
turning handle <span class="u">slowly</span> until gage shows 15 to 20 pounds pressure, but
no more. <span class="u">Caution</span>: “Cracking,” or opening a cylinder valve without
using the proper regulator valve (<a href="#PARA_39a">Par 39 <span class="u">a</span></a>), may result in explosive
pressure in the drums.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) Both tanks must be filled to within 2 inches of their tops. Close
valve on fuel-filling hose to halt flow at this level.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) If no additional flame throwers are to be filled, close
pressure-cylinder valve, or stop compressor or pump. Then, using
wrench, slightly loosen the air line at the drum, allowing pressure
to bleed. When the pressure in the drum has fallen to that of the
atmosphere, close regulator valve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">(7) Roll drum slightly and gently until fuel-filling hose is at top of
drum.</p>

<p class="p2">(8) If there are valves on each end of the fuel-filling hose, use
wrench to slightly loosen hose, allowing gradual escape of pressure.
Stand away from, and at the side of, the connection. Keep hose pointed
away from other personnel. When all pressure has been released,
complete unscrewing of hose.</p>

<p class="p2">(9) Wipe fuel-tank plug seats and the plug threads with a clean, dry
cloth. Then screw in filling plug and safety-head plug assemblies,
applying grease (<a href="#PARA_49b">Par 49 <span class="u">b</span></a>) if plug tends to freeze to seat. Tighten
with wrench. Wipe any spilled fuel from weapon.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_40">40. PRECAUTIONS WITH FUELS.</h4>

<p id="PARA_40a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Flammability</span>. All fuels used in flame throwers obviously are
highly flammable and must be handled, stored, and used with extreme
care. Diesel oil, fuel oil, and kerosene require the same care as does
gasoline.</p>

<p id="PARA_40b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Indoor storage</span>. When it becomes necessary to handle gasoline in
a room or building, the windows and doors should be open and care
taken that no unprotected flame which might ignite the fumes is in the
vicinity. The doors and windows should remain open for a sufficient
length of time afterward to allow any vaporized gasoline to escape.</p>

<p id="PARA_40c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Flames and sparks</span>. The presence of open flames, heated stoves,
electrical tools and apparatus, and other equipment likely to cause
sparks must not be permitted. Even nails and metal cleats in shoes are
a potential hazard in the presence of combustible fumes.</p>

<p id="PARA_40d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Smoking</span>. “No Smoking” signs must be posted in prominent places
about the premises and the rule against smoking must be strictly
enforced.</p>

<p id="PARA_40e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Ventilation and cleaning</span>. The buildings in which fuel is stored
or used must be well ventilated and thoroughly cleaned every day. No
rubbish or other flammable material should be permitted to remain in or
near such buildings.</p>

<p id="PARA_40f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Spillage</span>. Care should be taken that fuel is not spilled. Any
spillage should be removed promptly.</p>

<p id="PARA_40g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Safety cans</span>. Safety cans should be used, if possible, for storing
small quantities of gasoline, as they have covers that must be forcibly
held open to remove or add gasoline.</p>

<p id="PARA_40h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u">Rags</span>. Metal receptacles with metal lids should be provided for
discarded, oily, or gasoline-soaked rags. These rags must be disposed
of daily.</p>

<p id="PARA_40i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u">Electrical apparatus</span>. Vaporproof incandescent electric lamps,
switches, and other appliances of approved type should be used. Open
switches, relays, and similar apparatus, or motors with commutators,
must not be used where gasoline fumes may be encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p id="PARA_40j"><span class="u">j</span>. <span class="u">Hose</span>. Flexible metal, rubber, and rubber-metal hose should be
inspected regularly (at least four times a year) and discarded when
noticeably deteriorated.</p>

<p id="PARA_40k"><span class="u">k</span>. <span class="u">Toxic fumes</span>. Gasoline fumes are somewhat toxic and should not be
inhaled.</p>

<p id="PARA_40l"><span class="u">l</span>. <span class="u">Leaks</span>. Leaks must never be neglected, and the fact that gasoline
is a dangerous liquid must always be kept in mind. Inspections for
leaks should be made frequently, particularly at pipe and hose joints.</p>

<p id="PARA_40m"><span class="u">m</span>. <span class="u">Fire extinguishers</span>. Carbon tetrachloride, carbon dioxide, or
foam-type fire extinguishers should be provided and located where they
will be accessible in the event of fire. Sand, not water, should be
thrown on burning fuel if suitable extinguishers are not available.</p>

<p id="PARA_40n"><span class="u">n</span>. <span class="u">Leaded gasoline</span>. Gasoline often contains a poisonous lead
compound. Such gasoline, or fuel containing leaded gasoline, should not
be allowed to touch the body, especially the lips, eyes, open cuts, and
sores.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="Section_IX_OPERATION">Section IX OPERATION
UNDER UNUSUAL CONDITIONS</h3>

<h4 id="PARA_41">41. WET CONDITIONS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The M2-2 flame thrower may be carried and fired successfully
in the rain or even after short immersion in water. After use
when wet, it should be dried to prevent rusting, cleaned, and
lubricated. (Pars <a href="#PARA_49">49</a> and <a href="#PARA_55">55</a>) Areas where paint has worn off
should be touched up with fresh paint. The weapon should be
stored in a dry place. Moisture must not be allowed to enter
fuel, ingredients of fuel, or containers of ignition cylinders.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_42">42. DUST AND MUD.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Keep all possible dust, earth, and mud out of the flame thrower;
particles may interfere with the operation of spring case, valves,
bearings, and pressure regulator. Store weapons and auxiliary equipment
in closed chests and boxes when not in use. (<a href="#PARA_77">Par 77</a>) Clean before use.
(Pars <a href="#PARA_51">51</a> and <a href="#PARA_52">52</a>)</p>

<h4 id="PARA_43">43. HEAT.</h4>

<p class="noindent">A hot climate or exposure to the sun makes the fuel thinner when in
containers. Thin fuel has shorter range; it is largely consumed in the
air before it reaches usual effective ranges. Where the climate is
torrid, less gasoline or other thinning agents should be used in a fuel
blend than normally. (Pars <a href="#PARA_34">34</a> through <a href="#PARA_36">36</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PARA_44">44. COLD.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Cold weather reduces total heat produced at target but seldom enough
to seriously lower value of a firing mission. Incendiary effects may
be decreased because materiel is less flammable when cold. The weapon
may be used at temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. To
improve ignition, use more gasoline in fuel than normally. (Pars <a href="#PARA_34">34</a>
through <a href="#PARA_36">36</a>)</p>

<h4 id="PARA_45">45. WIND.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Flame throwers should not be fired into strong head winds or across
strong side winds. (<a href="#PARA_23">Par 23</a>)</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="Section_X_DEMOLITION">Section X DEMOLITION<br />
TO PREVENT ENEMY USE</h3>

<h4 id="PARA_46">46. DESTRUCTION PROCEDURE.</h4>

<p class="noindent">If circumstances should force abandonment of chemical warfare materiel
in the field, it is destroyed or rendered useless to prevent its use or
study by the enemy. The following methods are recommended:</p>

<p id="PARA_46a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Flame thrower</span>. One or more small-arms bullets through the fuel
tanks will prevent any immediate use of the flame thrower. Additional
rounds may be put through the pressure tank. If the pressure tank is
charged, the pressure-tank valve should be opened for a few seconds,
thus permitting the contents to dissipate. This is necessary if rounds
are to be fired point-blank. The gun may be rendered useless by bending
it over a hard object. A sledge or ax will demolish valves and tubes. A
fragmentation grenade will also achieve demolition.</p>

<p id="PARA_46b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Filling and charging apparatus</span>. The flexible tubing, gages, and
valves may be destroyed by blows with an ax, sledge, or other heavy
instrument. The large pressure cylinders are rendered useless by
releasing the contents and then destroying the valves by blows with an
ax or sledge. Cylinders can be stacked like cordwood in groups of five
and demolished by the detonation of four 1/2-pound blocks (2 pounds) of
TNT in their midst. The air compressor may be destroyed by a similar
procedure.</p>

<p id="PARA_46c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Fuel</span>. Burn.</p>

<p id="PARA_46d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Mixing apparatus</span>. Containers and filling lines may be rendered
useless by ax or sledge blows, or by small-arms fire.</p>

<p id="PARA_46e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Thickener</span>. Cans of thickener should be broken open. Contents
should be thrown into a fire or into a body of water.</p>

<p id="PARA_46f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Ignition cylinders</span>. Burn to destroy. Personnel should stay
several yards from the fire because the cylinders ignite with a slight
detonation.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_49">49. LUBRICATION.</h4>

<p id="PARA_49a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Gun group</span>. War Department Lubrication Order No. 4001
(<a href="#Fig_31">Fig 31</a>) shows the parts which require lubrication, the lubricants,
and the intervals.</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Lubricants</span>. Grease, general purpose, No. 1 is used,
except for temperatures below freezing, when grease, general
purpose. No. 0 is used. The bearing surfaces should be lightly
coated with the grease.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Frequency of lubrication</span>. The surfaces of the ignition-head
body which touch the spring case should be lubricated after
each use of the weapon. Other parts are lubricated after six
firing missions, six training sessions, or oftener. All should
be thoroughly cleaned (Pars <a href="#PARA_52">52</a>, <a href="#PARA_55">55</a>, and <a href="#PARA_56">56</a>) with gasoline,
dry cleaning solvent, or other solvent, then dried before lubrication.
If the gun is disassembled for any other reason, it should
be lubricated before reassembly.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Records</span>. To ascertain when six missions have been fired, a record
of firing (<a href="#PARA_2">Par 2</a>) should be kept with each flame thrower.</p>

<p id="PARA_49b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Tank group</span>. The tank group ordinarily requires no lubrication.
However, it may under the following exceptional circumstances:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) If the tank group has been immersed in water for several hours,
the flexible shaft of the pressure valve may have lost its lubricant.
If so, remove the shaft (<a href="#PARA_66b">Par 66 <span class="u">b</span></a>) and inspect. If lubricant is not
present, as indicated by difficulty of movement after removal, dip
the shaft in solvent to clean and then dip in warmed grease, general
purpose, No. 1. Replace shaft in valve.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) If filling or safety-head plugs (Figs <a href="#PARA_39">39</a> and <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>) tend to stick
to fuel tanks, apply grease, general purpose, No. 1 (No. 0 if below
freezing temperatures) before replacing plugs.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_50">50. GENERAL</h4>

<p class="noindent">Preventive maintenance services, as prescribed by Army Regulations,
are a function of using organization echelons of maintenance.
These services consist of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p id="PARA_50a"><span class="u">a</span>. Before, during, and after operation services performed by
the firers and assistants.</p>

<p id="PARA_50b"><span class="u">b</span>. Scheduled services performed by organizational maintenance
personnel (service when filling and charging, and service
after six firing missions).</p>

<h4 id="PARA_51">51. BEFORE-OPERATION SERVICE OF TANK GROUP.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The following services are to be performed before filling,
charging, and loading the flame thrower with pressure, fuel, and
ignition cylinder:</p>

<p id="PARA_51a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Pressure-tank valve</span>. Open and close pressure-tank valve
to test for ease of operation.</p>

<p id="PARA_51b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Threaded connections</span>. Check all threaded connections for
tightness, using appropriate wrenches.</p>

<p id="PARA_51c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Tank coupling</span>. Examine coupling for cleanliness and ease
of movement of lock and cams. (<a href="#PARA_70">Par 70</a>) Clean if necessary.

<p id="PARA_51d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Plugs</span>. Check filling plug and safety-head plug for completeness
of parts (<a href="#PARA_69a">Par 69 <span class="u">a</span></a>) and cleanliness of threads and seats. Clean, if
necessary, with cloth. If rod or rod and chain have broken off and
fallen in tank, turn tank upside down and remove. Remove deflector
tube from head (using hand, not wrench). Inspect to see if diaphragm
is intact. If diaphragm is ruptured, replace the safety head with an
unbroken head. (<a href="#PARA_69b">Par 69 b, c</a>) Reassemble plug, head, and deflector tube
in left fuel tank. (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig 11</a>) Tube should face to rear and at a 45-degree
angle to operator’s left shoulder. (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig 18</a>) Screw in deflector tube by
hand; do not use wrench on deflector tube. Tighten lock nut with wrench.</p>

<p id="PARA_51e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Pressure-tank clamp</span>. The clamp should hold the pressure
tank tightly in place. If tank is loose, a wooden splint or wedge
under the clamp may be used as a temporary expedient.</p>

<p id="PARA_51f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Carrier-frame bolts</span>. Check tightness. Use wrench.</p>

<p id="PARA_51g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Carrier</span>. (<a href="#PARA_71">Par 71</a>) Examine all canvas, webbing, and cord

flame thrower to dryer storage if mildew occurs.</p>

<p id="PARA_51h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u">Cord (lashing)</span>. Check for tightness. If necessary, make
tighter and use secure, slip-proof knots. When the tank group
is filled with fuel and adjusted on the firer, its weight should be
carried chiefly by the canvas and webbing, not by the metal frame.</p>

<p id="PARA_51i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u">Shoulder and body straps</span>. Adjust straps to fit firer. (Pars
<a href="#PARA_19">19</a> and <a href="#PARA_71">71</a>) A loose tank group can cause discomfort or injury
when the wearer changes positions while on a mission. Check
presence and condition of the two pins and two cotter pins which
hold shoulder straps to steel support. Check fasteners.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_52">52. BEFORE-OPERATION SERVICE OF GUN GROUP.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The following services are to be performed before filling, charging,
and loading with pressure, fuel, and ignition cylinder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p id="PARA_52a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Hose nipple, tank end</span>. Examine to be sure nipple is clean
and not badly nicked. If badly nicked, the nipple may not make
a tight seal at the tank coupling. A leak and loss of pressure
may result. See Paragraph <a href="#PARA_73d">73 <span class="u">d</span></a> for repair of the nipple.</p>

<p id="PARA_52b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Fuel hose</span>. Examine surface of hose for cracks or other signs of
deterioration. Special attention should be paid to portions adjacent to
the gun and tank coupling, which are subjected to severe flexing. If
hose is defective, replace. (<a href="#PARA_73b">Par 73 <span class="u">b</span>, <span class="u">c</span></a>) Do not patch.</p>

<p id="PARA_52c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Hose nipple, gun end</span>. Check tightness of threaded connection
between hose and fuel-valve body, using hand or very light wrench
pressure.</p>

<p id="PARA_52d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Shield</span>. Remove ignition shield. Check cleanliness of
threads on shield and on ignition-head body. If not clean, use
cloth. When reassembling (<a href="#PARA_18c">Par 18 <span class="u">c</span></a>), shield should turn freely
until it locks in correct position.</p>

<p id="PARA_52e"><span class="u">e. Valve lever and needle.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) There should be some play in
the valve lever. To test, remove ignition shield. Compress grip
safety and valve lever slowly, observing the motion of the valve
needle. The valve lever should move approximately 1/16 inch
before the needle begins to move.</p>

<p class="p2" id="PARA_52e2">(2) Valve needle should be seated firmly in the barrel nozzle.
After the valve lever is pulled back and released, no play should
occur in the needle. For adjustment of needle, see Paragraph <a href="#PARA_75d">75 <span class="u">d</span></a>.</p>

<p id="PARA_52f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Screws</span>. Use screw driver to test tightness of all screws.</p>

<p id="PARA_52g"><span class="u">g</span>. <span class="u">Spring retainer and plug</span>. Check tightness of spring retainer
and plug (<a href="#Fig_47">Fig 47</a>) by using hand or very light wrench pressure.</p>

<p id="PARA_52h"><span class="u">h</span>. <span class="u">Ignition head</span>. All exposed surfaces of the shield, nozzle,
needle, and other parts of the ignition head, or adjacent to it, should
be clean. If not, use cloth.</p>

<p id="PARA_52i"><span class="u">i</span>. <span class="u">Atomizer hole</span>. With the fuel valve held fully open, insert
a fine wire in the atomizer hole of the nozzle to clean the hole.
Then use cloth-wrapped splint to remove from the inside of the
nozzle any foreign matter pushed through the atomizer hole. If
such matter is not removed, it may interfere with the closing of
the fuel valve needle at the nozzle. Repeat procedure in <a href="#PARA_52e2"><span class="u">e</span> (2)</a>
above.</p>

<p id="PARA_52j"><span class="u">j</span>. <span class="u">Spring case</span>. Spring case should turn freely on ignition head.
If it does not, clean any grease or dirt from, surfaces with cloth
and relubricate. (<a href="#PARA_49">Par 49</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_52k"><span class="u">k</span>. <span class="u">Trigger</span>. Pull trigger once or twice to find whether it operates
easily and whether it returns to position. If not, clean and
lubricate trigger. (<a href="#PARA_49">Par 49</a>) Check condition of trigger spring.</p>

<p id="PARA_52l"><span class="u">l</span>. <span class="u">Trigger rod</span>. Check position of the trigger rod when trigger
is pulled back all the way as when firing. The rod should
extend approximately 1/16 inch beyond the end of the lug in the
ignition head. If it does not, bend the rod slightly, reverse position
of bearing, or replace worn parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PARA_53">53. SERVICE WHEN FILLING AND CHARGING.</h4>

<p id="PARA_53a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Inspection of fuel tanks</span>. Just before filling and charging,
remove plugs (<a href="#PARA_69b">Par 69 <span class="u">b</span></a>) and examine interior of fuel tanks to see
whether they are clean and free from foreign matter. If not clean,
flush with gasoline until clean.</p>

<p id="PARA_53b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Fuel level</span>. When filling (Pars <a href="#PARA_37">37</a> through <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>), see that fuel
reaches the same level in both tanks. If leveling does not occur,
the tank connector may be clogged with foreign matter. If so, clean,
as in <span class="u">a</span>, above. After filling, wipe plug seats with a cloth before
replacing plugs. Wipe any spilled fuel from weapon.</p>

<p id="PARA_53c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Pressure-tank valve</span>. Before charging the tank group with
air or nitrogen, open and close the pressure-tank valve several
times by hand to be sure it operates freely. If it does not, adjust
as described in Paragraph <a href="#PARA_66d">66 <span class="u">d</span></a>.</p>

testing gage from service kit.</p></div>

<p id="PARA_53d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Testing for leaks in pressure system</span>. After charging, and
as few hours as possible before a mission, use an 0-3,000-pound
gage furnished in service kit to test pressure. (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig 32</a>) To install
gage, unscrew check-valve cap and screw gage in check-valve
body. If pressure has fallen below that to which the tank was
charged (<a href="#PARA_32">Par 32</a>), a leak is indicated. Remove gage, replace
check-valve cap, and check for leaks at joints between pressure
tank and valve and between tank valve and check valve. (A wrench
should be used to tighten cap on check-valve body so as to avoid
producing an additional leak.) Large leaks can be felt or heard.
Small leaks can be detected by coating joints with soap-and-water
solution. Bubbles indicate leaks. If a leak is revealed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
pressure tank and pressure-tank valve, or between check valve
and pressure-tank valve, replace all three as a unit. If tests do
not show up the leak the tank may have been improperly charged.
It should be recharged and then retested.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_54">54. SERVICE WHEN FIRING.</h4>

<p id="PARA_54a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Failure to ignite</span>. Pull trigger repeatedly. If ignition cylinder
still fails to ignite, dirt may be wedged in ignition head.
Unscrew shield one-half turn. Screw it back, rapping shield with
the hand while turning. This should dislodge foreign matter.
Pull trigger again. Repeat procedure, if necessary.</p>

<p id="PARA_54b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Safety head “blows” (breaks)</span>. If safety head breaks, firing
mission cannot be carried out. On return, have head replaced.

<h4 id="PARA_56">56. SERVICE AFTER SIX FIRING MISSIONS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">After the flame thrower has been used on six firing missions
or the equivalent in training work, experienced personnel should
follow these directions:</p>

<p id="PARA_56a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Before-operation and after-operation service</span>. Follow the
same procedures as in Paragraphs 52, 53, and 55.</p>

<p id="PARA_56b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Test firing (or simulated firing).</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) If tactical conditions
permit test firing at a suitable test range (<a href="#PARA_15">Par 15</a>), fill the fuel
tanks with fuel. (Pars <a href="#PARA_37">37</a> through <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(2) If test firing with fuel is impracticable, fill fuel tanks with
clean water. (Be sure to dry all parts after test.)</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Remove filling-plug assembly</span>. (<a href="#PARA_69">Par 69</a>) Fish out the retainer
rod and chain by means of a bent wire.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) Do not unscrew the safety-head plug.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) Insert the testing plug with 0-to 500-pound pressure gage
(plug and gage are from service kit) in the filling-plug opening.
Tighten testing plug in seat with wrench.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) Fully charge pressure tank. (<a href="#PARA_32">Par 32</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(7) If test firing with fuel, load ignition cylinder. (<a href="#PARA_18">Par 18</a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(8) Open pressure-tank valve and simultaneously observe
pressure in fuel tanks by reading gage. The gage indicates the
pressure in both tanks. It should be between 350 and 390 pounds
per square inch.</p>

<p class="p2">(9) Read the gage at the expiration of not less than 5 minutes.
The tanks should have a pressure reading of not more than 390
pounds. If the pressure continues to increase beyond 390 pounds
and the safety head blows, replace the safety head and the pressure
regulator.</p>

<p class="p2">(10) Fire by operating controls (or simulate firing if tanks are
filled with water). The burst should last 3 seconds, during which
time the pressure should not drop below 260 pounds.</p>

<p class="p2">(11) If the pressure does not conform to the requirements
stated in (8), (9), and (10), adjust the pressure regulator upward
or downward. (<a href="#PARA_67d">Par 67 <span class="u">d</span></a>)</p>

<p class="p2">(12) While the above test firing is proceeding, check for leaks
at all joints and connections on the tank group. The pressure
system should be checked by painting the joints with soap-and-water
solution and by looking for bubbles which indicate leaks.
For replacement of parts where pressure leaks, see Paragraph
66. Fuel leaks may be seen without soap and water. For repair
of fuel leaks, see Paragraph 75 <span class="u">e</span>. The nozzle should be
observed by removing the ignition shield. Nozzle leaks are corrected
by cleaning, adjusting needle (<a href="#PARA_75d">Par 75 <span class="u">d</span></a>), or by regrinding.
(<a href="#PARA_75e">Par 75 <span class="u">e</span></a>) If this is not successful, replace both needle and barrel
as a unit.</p>

<p id="PARA_56c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Fuel valve</span>. Discharge all pressure from the gun by operating
the fuel valve. Carefully remove the valve grip and grip
support. (<a href="#PARA_74">Par 74</a>) Look for signs of leakage at the valve diaphragm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
If a leak is present, replace valve-diaphragm assembly.
(Pars <a href="#PARA_75b">75 <span class="u">b</span></a> and <a href="#PARA_75c">75 <span class="u">c</span></a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_56d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Valve grip</span>. Disassemble the valve grip (<a href="#PARA_74">Par 74</a>) and lubricate.
(<a href="#PARA_49">Par 49</a>)</p>

<p id="PARA_56e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Carrier</span>. Tighten the carrier cord.</p>

<p id="PARA_56f"><span class="u">f</span>. <span class="u">Gun interior</span>. If thickened fuel has been fired, disassemble
the gun. All parts should be cleaned of accumulations of
dried fuel. Lubricate (<a href="#PARA_49">Par 49</a>) and reassemble. If liquid fuel
has been fired, flush gun with clean gasoline. Disassemble only
enough to lubricate. Reassemble.</p>

TANK GROUP</h3>

<h4 id="PARA_65">65. GENERAL.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The tank group stores fuel and pressure. The fuel is placed under
pressure when the pressure-tank valve is opened. The tank
group is supported upon the firer’s back and shoulders by the
carrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PARA_66">66. PRESSURE TANK AND VALVE ASSEMBLY.</h4>

<p id="PARA_66a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Description and functioning</span>. The pressure tank and valve
assembly (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig 33</a>) includes:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Pressure tank</span>. The pressure tank is a lightweight, airplane-type
cylinder, able to withstand the great pressure which
it contains. The tank is charged with air or nitrogen at 1,700 to
2,100 pounds per square inch pressure by use of auxiliary equipment
as described in Paragraphs <a href="#PARA_31">31</a> and <a href="#PARA_32">32</a>. This pressure stays
in the pressure tank until the weapon is ready to be fired. Opening
of the pressure-tank valve releases air or nitrogen through
the pressure regulator to the fuel tanks. Oxygen or combustible
gases are never used in the tank because a violent explosion may
result. The tank is large in capacity to assure ample pressure,
and hence full range, for the entire load of fuel. The pressure-tank
clamp (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig 39</a>), a steel-strap device with hinge and toggle-type
latch, holds the pressure tank in place on the fuel tanks.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Pressure-tank valve</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_33">33</a> and <a href="#Fig_34">34</a>) This valve is
screwed into the bottom of the pressure tank. The valve stem
slides into the valve end of the valve flexible shaft. When opened
by means of the valve handle and valve flexible shaft, the valve
permits passage of compressed air or nitrogen through tubes
and the pressure regulator to the fuel tanks. The valve is of the
quick-opening, packless, diaphragm type.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Pressure-valve handle and valve flexible shaft</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_33">33</a>
and <a href="#Fig_34">34</a>) The pressure-valve handle is held by a small nut on the
end of the valve flexible shaft, which in turn is connected to the
pressure-tank valve by means of the valve stem and a large hex
nut. The handle and shaft extend to the right of the tank group,
enabling the firer to open and close the valve without assistance
when carrying the weapon. The handle slips over the end of the
shaft and is held to it by a nut. The shaft is held to one of the
fuel tanks by a clamp, nut, and bolt welded to the tank.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Check valve</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_33">33</a> through <a href="#Fig_35">35</a>) The check valve has
the same function as the valve on a vehicular tire tube, but it is
much heavier in construction and different in design because the
pressure in the flame thrower is 50 times greater than that in an
automobile tire tube. Connected by threads to the pressure valve,
the check valve permits compressed air or nitrogen to enter the
pressure tank during charging (Pars <a href="#PARA_31">31</a> and <a href="#PARA_32">32</a>) but prevents
its escape when the outside source of pressure is removed. The
cap is removed from the check valve only for charging or testing.</p>

<p id="PARA_66b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Removal</span>. (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig 33</a>) To prevent damage to threads, leaks,
and loss of pressure and range, remove pressure tank and valve
assembly only when necessary.</p>

from the pressure system before disassembling or removing
any part or assembly of the pressure system. To release
pressure, operate fuel valve (<a href="#PARA_26">Par 26</a>) and hold open until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>

<p id="PARA_66c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Installation</span>. (Figs <a href="#Fig_33">33</a> and <a href="#Fig_39">39</a>) To install:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Insert pressure tank (with pressure-tank valve and check
valve mounted on the tank) through the pressure-tank clamp. Be
sure to aline the regulator tube, elbow, and pressure-tank valve
threads carefully so that they cannot be damaged when connecting.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Close the pressure-tank clamp.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) Start the threaded connections by hand to be sure they are
well alined. Do not force. Use wrench for final tightening, but do
not apply great torque to the wrench.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) Insert the valve flexible shaft through small clamp into
the pressure-tank valve. Using wrench, tighten the large hex
nut located between shaft and valve.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) Tighten the clamp on the valve flexible shaft.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) Place pressure-valve handle on threaded end of the shaft.
Place nut on threaded end and tighten with adjustable-end wrench.</p>

<p id="PARA_66d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Adjustment</span>. If valve handle cannot be turned by hand:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Remove flexible shaft and handle. Never apply a wrench
to these parts.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Turn end of pressure-valve stem with wrench to open
valve.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) If stem will not turn, replace the tank and valve.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) If stem turns, work it back and forth with wrench.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) Reconnect flexible shaft and handle.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) If handle does not turn easily, repeat the process until
handle turns, or replace tank and valve.</p>

<p class="p2">(7) Close valve before charging tank.</p>

<p id="PARA_66e"><span class="u">e</span>. <span class="u">Maintenance.</span></p>

<p class="p2">(1) If either pressure tank, pressure-tank valve, or check
valve are damaged or defective, all three must be replaced as a
unit. No attempt may be made to repair any of these parts or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
their connections. If makeshift repairs or improvised parts are
devised, serious accidents can result because of the extremely
high pressures to which the equipment is subjected.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Keep all threaded connections tightened. If a leak is suspected
at any threaded connection, follow procedure in Paragraph
<a href="#PARA_53d">53 <span class="u">d</span></a>.</p>

<h4 id="PARA_67">67. PRESSURE REGULATOR.</h4>

<p id="PARA_67a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Description and functioning</span>. The regulator automatically
reduces the variable pressure of air or nitrogen in the pressure
tank to a constant operating pressure of approximately 350 pounds
per square inch in the fuel tanks. The regulator is located at a
protected position in the tank group of the M2-2 portable flame
thrower, where it is not readily subject to tampering or damage
from the outside. The regulator tube with fittings connects the
pressure-tank valve and pressure regulator. (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig 33</a>) Its outlet
is connected to the fuel tanks by the diffusion-pipe assembly.
(<a href="#PARA_68a">Par 68 <span class="u">a</span></a>) Either of two interchangeable types of regulators
is furnished: the spring type (Figs <a href="#Fig_33">33</a>, <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>, and <a href="#Fig_37">37</a>), and the
dome type (<a href="#Fig_38">Fig 38</a>).</p>

<p id="PARA_67b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Removal of pressure regulator</span>. After release of all pressure:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) Remove carrier (<a href="#PARA_71b">Par 71 <span class="u">b</span></a>), if necessary.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) Using wrench, unscrew the flared tube nuts and other fittings.</p>

<p id="PARA_67c"><span class="u">c</span>. <span class="u">Installation of pressure regulator</span>. Line up pressure regulator,
regulator tube, diffusion-pipe assembly, and fittings carefully so they
will not be damaged when threads are tightened. Start threads with the
hands. Apply only moderate wrench pressure to complete tightening.
Replace carrier or carrier pack if either has been removed.</p>

<p id="PARA_67d"><span class="u">d</span>. <span class="u">Adjustment of pressure regulator</span>. The pressure regulator
ordinarily requires no attention other than checking and tightening
connections with the regulator tube and the diffusion-pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> assembly.
If a defect in the regulator is indicated by falling off of the range
of the weapon or by frequent breakage of the safety-head diaphragm (<a href="#PARA_56b">Par 56 <span class="u">b</span></a>),
 the following procedure should be carried out. (When using
wrenches, do not apply excessive force.)</p>

assembly includes:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Fuel tanks</span>. Two alloy steel fuel tanks hold the fuel before it
is propelled to the target. They have a combined capacity, including
void, of 4-1/2 gallons. A void of approximately 1/2 gallon is left in
tanks when filling to allow for expansion and to permit entry of the
compressed nitrogen or air. To speed filling and cleaning of the tanks,
two openings are provided on top of the fuel tanks. The openings are
threaded to receive the filling-plug assembly and the safety-head plug
assembly, which are interchangeable in the openings. Filling operations
involve the use of auxiliary equipment and are described in Paragraphs
<a href="#PARA_34">34</a> through <a href="#PARA_40">40</a>. The carrier and the pressure system are supported on the
fuel tanks.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Hose connector</span>. The hose connector is the outlet for fuel from
the fuel tanks. It is located so that nearly all the fuel is propelled
from the weapon if firing positions are correct. (<a href="#PARA_24">Par 24</a>) One end is
welded to an opening in the tank connector. The other end is threaded
into the tank coupling.</p>

air or nitrogen from the pressure regulator to each of the fuel tanks.
A flared tube connection and elbow connect the stem of the T to the
pressure regulator. The horizontal tubes of the T extend into the fuel
tanks and are welded to the fuel tank walls. Within the fuel tanks
these tubes are perforated with holes which permit ready escape of the
compressed nitrogen or air into the fuel tanks when the pressure-tank
valve is open.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Valve lever</span>. This control is made to fit the fingers and is
mounted in front of and between the two parts of the valve grip. A
pin at the top of the lever fits into holes in left and right valve
grips and serves as a pivot, governing the movement of the lever. When
the lever and the grip safety are compressed simultaneously by the
operator, the valve is thereby opened and fuel is ejected from the gun.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Grip safety</span>. This control is grasped by the hand simultaneously
with the valve lever. It is mounted back of and between left and right
valve grips. A pin at the base of the safety fits into holes in the

<p id="PARA_75a"><span class="u">a</span>. <span class="u">Description and functioning</span>. (<a href="#Fig_47">Fig 47</a>) This assembly is part of the
fuel valve. It includes the barrel, valve body, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> operating parts
contained in the barrel and valve body. The assembly consists of:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Valve body</span>, an aluminum housing, located at the rear of the
gun and mounted on the grip support by means of four screws and lock
washers. The valve body has four large threaded openings. The lower
opening leads into the valve grip. The side opening, which forms a
Y with the main portion of the body, is connected to the fuel-hose
assembly. The front opening is screwed on the barrel. The rear opening
is closed by the spring retainer and plug.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Valve-diaphragm assembly</span>, which transmits and reverses the
movement imparted to it by the rocker arm of the valve grip. (<a href="#PARA_74a">Par 74 <span class="u">a</span></a>)
It also serves as a seal, keeping fuel from entering the valve
grip. The valve-diaphragm assembly includes:</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">a</span>) <span class="u">Yoke shaft</span>, on which the rocker arm bears at the lower end of
the shaft.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) <span class="u">Yoke</span>, a Y-shaped metal part which fits on the upper end of the
yoke shaft and is held to it by a steel pin. The yoke transmits motion
from the shaft to the yoke block, and is located within the valve body
when the valve is assembled.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">c</span>) <span class="u">Diaphragm</span>, a synthetic-rubber diaphragm held in a steel sleeve,
which fits snugly in the lower opening of the valve body. The yoke
shaft passes through the diaphragm.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Diaphragm support, washer, and cap</span>, which hold the
valve-diaphragm assembly in place in the valve body.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Spring retainer</span>, a brass, hollow bushing which screws into the
rear opening of the valve body, and which is threaded internally
to receive the plug. The retainer has a hexagonal head to take a
1-3/8-inch wrench. As its name implies, the retainer holds the valve
spring in position.</p>

<p class="p2">(5) <span class="u">Plug</span>, a brass part, resembling a cap screw, which fits into
the spring retainer, closing off the rear end of the gun. It permits
adjustment of the needle (see <a href="#PARA_75d"><span class="u">d</span></a> below) without removing the valve
spring and spring retainer.</p>

<p class="p2">(6) <span class="u">Valve spring</span>, a coil spring located in the valve body between the
spring retainer and the yoke block. The spring keeps the needle seated
in the nozzle until compression of the grip safety and valve lever
forces back the yoke block, spring, and needle.</p>

<p class="p2">(7) <span class="u">Yoke block</span>, a steel piece, 1 inch long, which fits into the arms
of the yoke Y. It is secured by an internal thread to the valve needle.
Movement of the yoke in turn moves the yoke block and the valve needle.</p>

<p class="p2">(8) <span class="u">Lock nut</span>, on the valve-needle thread at the rear of the yoke
block, which locks the block on the needle.</p>

<p class="p2">(9) <span class="u">Valve-needle</span>, a pointed rod, which extends through the inside
of the barrel from the yoke block to the nozzle. The valve needle is
seated in the nozzle except when firing. It controls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> ejection of
fuel from the nozzle. Two sets of three fins each, known as needle
guides, are mounted on the front and rear of the needle, respectively.
These guides keep the needle centered in the barrel. The rear end
of the valve needle is threaded to hold the yoke block and permit
adjustment of the needle by means of the lock nut which screws on the
threads. (See <a href="#PARA_75d"><span class="u">d</span></a> below.)</p>

<p class="p2">(10) <span class="u">Barrel</span> (Figs <a href="#Fig_47">47</a> and <a href="#Fig_54">54</a>), which carries the fuel to the ignition
head. It also supports or contains other components of the gun. The
barrel assembly is replaced as a unit with the needle. It consists of a
tube, made of thin metal, with a threaded fitting at the back end, and
a nozzle brazed into the front end of the tube. The nozzle ejects the
fuel from the barrel through the ignition head. The fuel emerges from
two holes in the nozzle:</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">a</span>) <span class="u">Atomizer hole</span>, a small opening which sprays a fine, readily
ignited mist of fuel. This helps ignite the main stream of fuel.</p>

<p class="p3">(<span class="u">b</span>) <span class="u">Main hole</span>, which is tapered inside, and which conveys the main
stream of fuel from the barrel. When the gun is not being fired, the
valve needle is seated in the main hole of the nozzle. When the gun is
being fired, the needle is withdrawn from the nozzle seat, permitting
the fuel to be forced from the gun.</p>

<p id="PARA_75b"><span class="u">b</span>. <span class="u">Removal of barrel and valve-body assembly</span>. If gun group and
tank group are connected, release any pressure in the fuel tanks by

the fuel when the flame thrower is fired. It is mounted on the fore
part of the barrel. It consists of:</p>

<p class="p2">(1) <span class="u">Ignition-head body</span>, which includes half of the front grip. Three
set screws serve to tighten the ignition-head body to the barrel. The
ignition-head body is made of aluminum.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <span class="u">Trigger and trigger bearing</span>, held between the ignition-head body
and the coverplate by the trigger screw.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <span class="u">Trigger rod</span>, one end of which is held in the trigger bearing,
the other extending through the ignition-head body. Pulling the
trigger shoves the trigger rod forward, causing it to push a match in
the ignition cylinder. The match ignites an incendiary charge in the
ignition cylinder.</p>

<p class="p2">(4) <span class="u">Trigger spring</span>, which hooks over a projection of the trigger and
is held at its lower end by a screw, which is held in the ignition-head

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
